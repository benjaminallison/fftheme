# version Must match version exactly

# 1.2.x 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0
# 
# In the simplest terms, the tilde matches the most recent minor version (the middle number). ~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.
# 
# The caret, on the other hand, is more relaxed. It will update you to the most recent major version (the first number). ^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.x release including 1.3.0, but will hold off on 2.0.0.
# 
# ~ allows the right most version segment to increment above the given value. Consequently, ~1.2.3 will accept versions 1.2.3 through to 1.2.Nth. While ~1.2 will accept 1.2.* through to 1.Nth.*
